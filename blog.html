                    <div class="ie">
                        <img src="https://blog.schoolspecialty.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/How-to-Help-Your-Students-Overcome-Math-Anxiety-1200x624.jpg" alt="lyqa">

                    <p> Imagine this: Terrance has aced his quiz on performing four operations on multi-digit numbers. In fact, he knows the standard algorithms so well that he finished first in his class. Then why is it that Terrance cannot seem to solve word problems involving the same exact concept? Why does he get stuck and not know how to start?</p>
                    <p>As we know, familiarity and fluency with basic operations and standard algorithms is vital in building a solid math foundation and becoming a successful math student. Furthermore, we cannot get around memorizing and knowing all the math vocabulary. However, as the math state standards and testing move more towards testing students' critical thinking skills than simple calculations or recalling facts, more and more students are getting frustrated and discouraged. Many students think to themselves, "I know all the math but there is too much reading in this problem. I don't know how to start." </p>
                    <p>As a middle and high school math teacher, I witnessed this in every one of my classes. Students were experts at solving two-step algebra equations, but once they saw words instead of numbers or variables, they were stymied. As we focus more on cross-curricular and problem-solving skills, it is important to teach our students how to approach these word problems without panicking or getting frustrated.</p>
                    <p> There are numerous ways to approach word problems. We know not all students learn the same and the only way to find the style that works is through trial and error. One of the tried and true strategies in solving word problems is circling and underlining numbers and/or keywords. This is a great place to start; although as more complex the problem gets, trickier it becomes knowing what to do with these keywords. Among the many strategies that can be used to get started on a word problem, I would like to briefly explore the importance of drawing.</p>
                    <p>Children learn to count by looking at drawings of apples and using their fingers to point and count. If a word problem mentions 3 apples, you may not need to draw 3 apples but draw them anyway; this way, you engage many different parts of your body. If the problem mentions a rectangular garden, the first step is to draw a rectangle. This will help the child think once more about what they know about a rectangle: opposite sides are equal in length and there are four right angles. By looking at the drawing, they may remember or realize a fact that they would not have by just passively reading. This will go all the way to Geometry where students have to learn to draw complex geometric figures and diagrams from descriptions. They will also need to learn to interpret those figures to obtain important information. This is the first step in practicing that skill.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the day, just giving these strategies and tips to your child will not help them do any better. As your child's academic guide at home, you need to model how to approach and solve a word problem. As you read the problem, show your child how you would circle, underline, and draw the figures. It is also helpful for you to speak aloud your thought process: “OK, it looks like the garden is increasing in length but decreasing in width, so the new garden will look something like this.” Then, scaffold the problem to show your child how you would break the problem down: “I need to first find out the new length of the garden. Looks like I can do this by adding 20 to 100. Then I can use that to find the new width.” It is okay if you get stuck or make mistakes; this will model how to persevere in solving word problems.</p>
                    <p>As children progress through elementary and middle school math, many children already begin to think, ‘I am not a math person.’ Majority of these children are experts at solving math equations using algorithms or sets of rules. To bridge the gap between solving algorithmic problems and having to apply critical thinking skills to word problems, it is important for you to model and guide your children at home. After all, every child is a “math person”; they just need the right guidance and encouragement from the people they admire.</p>
